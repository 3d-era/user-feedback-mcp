# User Feedback MCP

This is a project based on [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp), to make it easier for the LLM to collect user feedback that requires manual interaction. For more information about the Model Context Protol, see [this post](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart).

## Development

You need [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed globally: `pip install uv` and then:

```sh
uv run fastmcp dev server.py
```

## Installation (Cline)

TODO: add instructions on how to add this tool to Cline.
